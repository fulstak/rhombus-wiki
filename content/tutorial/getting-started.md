## Choose your wallet

If you're new to Rhombus or cryptocurrencies in general, we recommend downloading our flagship wallet – **[Rhombus Desktop](/tutorial/rhombus-desktop/)**. It is our most actively developed wallet offering all the main features Rhombus offers.

Alternatively, feel free to [compare all available wallets](/learn/wallets/#comparison) and choose whichever fits you the best.


## Discover RHOM

> RHOM is native cryptocurrency of Rhombus ecosystem.

In short: it's based on always up-to-date Bitcoin code, meaning it's constantly getting all the performance and security updates (believe it or not, this is not standard) with additional privacy enhancements on top of it. But there's so much more...

Some must-read articles about RHOM currency include:

- **[Transaction types](/learn/privacy/transaction-types/)** – quick intro to Rhombus's different privacy coins (Public vs Private transactions)
- **[Staking](/learn/staking/intro/)** – securing Rhombus network and earning interest on your owned coins in the process (easy, hassle-free and without a need for expensive "mining" equipment)


## Buy RHOM

When you're familiar with what RHOM can do, you're ready to buy your first RHOM.

Visit our official website for up-to-date [overview of available Exchanges](https://rhombus.io/part-exchanges). If you don't own any Bitcoin, don't worry – some exchanges offer buying RHOM with a credit card.
