Before we dive into this guide, you might want to familiarize yourself with [theory of cold staking](/wiki/learn/staking/intro#cold-staking), so that you know what we're doing and why.

Rhombus's cold staking setup is quite flexible, meaning there are many options how to stake – each approach has its pros and cons. This guide will outline all the possible variants, so that you can choose your own balance between convenience, privacy and security.


## Where will you stake?

{{< hint info >}}
We won't mention "classic" [standalone staking](/wiki/tutorial/staking/intro/), which happens automatically in your unlocked wallet and therefore isn't a case of cold staking.
{{< /hint >}}

First, you need to decide where (or how) will you stake.

With Rhombus cold staking, you have the following options:

- **Staking on your own "DSD"** – Dedicated Staking Devices (or "DSD" for short) are usually small single-board computers (like Raspberry Pi 3+ or Rock64) or even servers/VPS, that are running 24/7 and therefore are ideal for staking non-stop. These are ideal for larger hodlers, geeks and tinkerers, anybody who wants total control over their funds and support the network with full node.
- **Staking on staking pool** – Staking pools are in a way DSDs as well, but offered for public. As with mining pools, all pool members are staking together and all staking rewards are proportionally split between its members. That's why pools are ideal for smaller holders, but also beginners and those who are not comfortable playing with command line – kind of a "connect, stake & forget" approach.

**Based on your preferences, pick one**. If you're not sure, don't worry and start with staking on a pool. You can switch to DSD anytime you want (or the other way around).

|                            | Staking on DSD             | Staking on pool                   |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Setup difficulty**       | higher                     | trivial                           |
| **Setup cost**             | hardware & energy          | _none_                            |
| **Security**               | your hardware, your rules  | you're depending on pool operator |
| **Staking rewards**        | 100% yours                 | pool incl. fees (usually 1–3 %)   |
| **Ideal for hodlers with** | approx. 4,000+ RHOM        | any amount (even small)           |
| **Network effect**         | full node – increases decentralization | centralizes funds on few bigger nodes |

## Get staking public key

Now it's time to get your public key for staking. You will need it for configuring your main wallet to delegate the staking to the staking device (Pool/DSD). Based on your choice, follow the links below to get your public key:

{{< tabs "get-pubkey" >}}

{{< tab "Staking Pool" >}}
### Using Staking Pool

Getting the public key from a staking Pool couldn't be easier. Visit our [list of available Staking Pools](/wiki/learn/staking/pools/#available-staking-pools), pick one that you like and visit it's homepage. Right at the top, you'll see the **public key for staking** (or "**Pool address**" on some pools).

{{< label info >}}Note{{< /label >}} Pool public keys begin with `Rcs` and usually look similar to this:
```

```
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Dedicated Staking Device" >}}
### Using Dedicated Staking Device

If you haven't set up your DSD yet, follow [Staking on DSD with Partyman](/wiki/tutorial/staking/on-dedicated-device/) guide to install latest Rhombus Core daemon on your device, generate a new wallet and a new staking public key along with it.

{{< label info >}}Note{{< /label >}} Public keys generated by Rhomtools begin with `prom` and usually look similar to this:
```

```

When you get the public key for staking, **copy it and save it for later**.


## Connect your wallet

The staking device part is now successfully configured – now onto connecting our wallet to it.

Rhombus has a nice selection of various wallets for different needs. Comparing all their features is out of the scope of this guide, but feel free to check [Rhombus wallets: overview](/wiki/learn/wallets/overview) for more information. We'll focus here on the staking aspects only.

- **[Rhombus Desktop](/wiki/tutorial/wallets/rhombus-desktop/)** – our flagship wallet, with easy cold staking configuration
- **[Rhombus Core](/wiki/tutorial/wallets/rhombus-core/)** – time-tested wallet with advanced features ([Coin Control](/wiki/tutorial/privacy/coin-control/)) and compatibility with [hardware wallets](/wiki/learn/wallets/hardware)
- **[Rhombus Copay](/wiki/tutorial/wallets/rhombus-copay/)** – mainly for mobile, multiplatform wallet with user-friendly [multi-sig](/wiki/tutorial/security/multisig/) feature
- **[Hardware wallets](/wiki/learn/wallets/hardware)** (Trezor & Ledger wallets) – secure hardware devices for storing cryptocurrency private keys, offline and away from hackers

{{< tabs "connect-wallet" >}}

{{< tab "Rhombus Desktop" >}}
### Rhombus Desktop

1. Open Rhombus Desktop
2. On **Overview** page, locate the Cold Staking widget (in right sidebar) and click on the `+` button in it
3. Paste the **staking public key**/**pool address** (that you saved before)
4. Click `Enable cold staking` button to confirm
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Rhombus Core / Ledger" >}}
### Rhombus Core

1. Open Rhombus Core
2. Go to **Window → Staking Setup**
3. Paste the **staking public key**/**pool address** (that you saved before) into the **Cold staking change address** field and click `Apply`
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Rhombus Copay" >}}
### Rhombus Copay

1. Open Rhombus Copay
2. Select your wallet from overview
3. Click on **Staking** tab/icon in the bottom navigation
4. You should see a "Wallet not staking yet" screen – click on the `Setup Cold Staking` button
5. Paste the **staking public key**/**pool address** (that you saved before) into the **Staking key (Pool address or Node public key)** field; you can optionally also label the key so you know _where_ are you staking (e.g. "Pool XYZ" or "My Raspberry Pi") and confirm by clicking `Enable Cold Staking` button
{{< /tab >}}

Now we've manged to connect your wallet to the Staking Node (your DSD or Pool of your choice).

With this setup, each time a bunch of your coins stake, they will get "moved" to the Staking Node and start staking on it. This is the best way to move your coins naturally to the Staking Node, especially if you are privacy-conscious.

## Zapping coins

If you want or need to move your coins to the Staking Node right away, you can do that with "zapping". That is useful, when you have either a small amount of coins (that would take ages to stake by themselves) or when you can't have your main wallet online and staking 24/7.

{{< hint info >}}
**Keep in mind that this step is entirely optional**.\
Zapping coins only accelerates the whole process of moving your coins to the Staking Node.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< tabs "zapping-coins" >}}

{{< tab "Rhombus Desktop" >}}
### Rhombus Desktop

Again, zapping coins is very easy and straightforward in Rhombus Desktop:

1. Click on the `Zap` button on the cold staking widget
2. Click on `Zap to 100%` to initiate the "zapping" process

You should now see a new transaction in your History, which automatically moved your coins to the Staking Node.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Rhombus Core" >}}
### Rhombus Core

In Rhombus Core, we need to **enable Coin Control** first:

1. **Settings → Options…**
2. In the **Wallet** tab, check "Enable coin control features"
3. Confirm by clicking `OK`

Then **generate a new Receiving address**:

1. In **Receive** tab → click `Request payment`
2. Copy the generated address into your clipboard

**Send some small amount to your newly generated address using all available inputs**

1. In **Send** tab → under **Coin Control** Features click on `Inputs…`
2. Check all available inputs (you can click the `(un)select all` button) and confirm with `OK`
3. Copy your previously generated receiving address to the **Pay to** field (like if you would pay yourself)
4. Set the transaction amount to some small value (like 0.001 RHOM)
5. Click `Send`

This will send all but those 0.001 RHOM to the connected Staking Node.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Rhombus Copay" >}}
### Rhombus Copay

1. Open Rhombus Copay
2. Select your wallet from overview
3. Click on **Staking** tab/icon in the bottom navigation
4. You should see a "Wallet is staking" screen → click the `Zap` button
5. New window appears, confirm the action by clicking on `Zap` again
6. Confirm the transaction fee for zapping → `Proceed`
7. Enter your password/fingerprint for sending transactions

The zap transaction is now being sent and your coins are successfully on Staking Node.
