Rhombus Core is more lightweight than [Rhombus Desktop](/tutorial/wallets/rhombus-desktop/), offers some advanced features like Coin Control and compatibility with [hardware wallets](/learn/wallets/hardware/).

However it acts like a wallet only, so you won't have access to Rhombus Open Marketplace.
