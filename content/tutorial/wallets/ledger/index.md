## About Ledger Wallet

[Ledger Nano (S/X)](https://www.ledger.com/) is a hardware wallet which stores user's private keys in a secure hardware device.

Hardware wallets have major advantages over standard software wallets: **private keys are stored in a secure chip, and cannot be transferred out of the device**. That means your funds are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.

For these reasons, we highly recommend users to protect their funds by setting up a Ledger or other [compatible hardware wallet](/learn/wallets/hardware/).


## Requirements

Before starting the setup process, make sure you have:

- **Ledger Nano S/X** hardware wallet – initialized and [updated to latest firmware](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Update-Ledger-Nano-S-firmware)
- **Ledger Live** app [ready to use](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006395233)
- **[Rhombus Core](/tutorial/wallets/rhombus-core/) wallet** installed and fully synced to the Rhombus network

{{< hint warning >}}
**Linux users:** Make sure you have added the `udev` rules to allow device access – see [Fix connection issues](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues) (under Linux tab) for more info. If you already have a working Ledger wallet, you can skip this.

## Installation

### Ledger Rhombus app

First, we need to install Rhombus on your Ledger device (feel free to follow [official Ledger's guide](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007687153) though it's the same):

  1. open the **Manager** in Ledger Live
  2. connect and unlock your Ledger Nano S
  3. if asked, allow the manager on your device by pressing the right button
  4. find Rhombus app in the catalog
  5. click the **Install** button of the app

Note that if you're forced to uninstall Rhombus app from your Ledger (due to lack of space), you'll have to repeat these steps to access your funds. Don't worry, your coins will stay safe even if the app isn't installed in the meantime.

### Rhombus Core configuration

{{< hint alert >}}
**If you already have a Rhombus wallet on this computer**,\
make sure to [back up the wallet.dat file](/tutorial/security/backup-restore-wallet/) by renaming or moving it elsewhere!

  1. launch [Rhombus Core](/tutorial/wallets/rhombus-core/) on your computer
  2. go to _Window → HD Wallet_ (if it's the first time you're setting up a wallet on this computer or if you don't have any `wallet.dat` file in your Rhombus config folder, then Rhombus Core will automatically bring you to this dialog)
  3. click on the **Hardware Device** tab
  4. connect your Ledger Nano S to your computer via USB
  5. make sure the device is properly unlocked (and already initialized via Ledger Live)
  6. click on **Import**
  7. when your Rhombus Core wallet says _Waiting for device_, follow the instructions displayed on your Ledger hardware wallet screen

Your Rhombus Core client is now ready to be used in conjunction with your Ledger hardware wallet!
