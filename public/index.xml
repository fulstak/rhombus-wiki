      <description>RHOM is hosted by its own blockchain and is not a token built on another chain (i.e. ERC-20 tokens).
Advantages Being built on the latest Bitcoin codebase not only allows the Rhombus platform to benefit from both Bitcoin’s stability and security, but also enables developers to leverage and easily fork any product, service and technology development from the Bitcoin developer community.
Recent Bitcoin developments implemented in Rhombus include but are not limited to:</description>

This has the added benefit of making all transactions (including private ones) go through Segwit by default, resulting in better scalability and cheaper transaction fees.</description>

 No chargebacks – all cryptocurrency transactions are final, no chargebacks are possible Complete control – you are the only owner of the private keys to your wallet, no one can freeze your account or shut it down  If further security and financial privacy are important to your and your business, see our Rhombus Open Marketplace, which was developed with exactly those in mind.</description>

While it could eventually be enabled by default or through the Settings page, Tor currently needs to be activated manually to route your Rhombus Desktop connection through its network.</description>

      <title>Securely storing Recovery Phrases</title>
      <link>https://rhombus.io/wiki/tutorial/security/recovery-phrase/</link>

      <guid>https://rhombus.io/wiki/tutorial/security/recovery-phrase/</guid>
      <description>Recovery Phrases (sometimes also called Mnemonic or just Seed) are strings of usually 12, 18 or 24 words, which are used to recover crypto wallets in cases of emergency. That being said, whoever gets access to your Recovery Phrase can access your coins as well. This presents a security risk if your Recovery Phrase gets stolen or discovered by some malicious actor.
Finding the right balance Each security layer used to protect your Recovery Phrase (and optionally Recovery Passphrase) makes it harder for everyone to get access to your coins – that includes both attackers and yourself.</description>

      <description>Your funds are backed up by Recovery Phrase (~ mnemonic seed) during wallet creation and that is enough to keep your coins safe. However if you want to backup all the additional data like addresses saved in Address Book and more, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to backup your wallet.dat file.
Always backup your wallet.dat to a secure place (USB, external drive etc.) – if anyone would get access to it and knew your wallet password, they could steal your coins!</description>

      <description>About MAD Escrow Game Theory How does it work? Private by design Scalability     About MAD Escrow Marketplaces usually have mechanisms in place to resolve disputes between buyers and vendors. This is a vital part of e-commerce because trusting strangers, especially when money is involved, has never proven to be reliable. As buyers and vendors do not know and trust each other, there has to be protection against one of the party never honoring their end of the trade.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing that Rhombus Desktop or Rhombus Core wallet is not syncing any further, then it might be because you got caught on a fork due to the latest hardfork.
If you execute any transaction during this time, it will appear as if you&amp;rsquo;ve lost the coins, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry. Nothing has left your wallet.

      <description>A Staking Node is a full blockchain node which has been configured to stake on behalf of your wallet (aka it has been delegated staking power over your wallet). The Staking Node is a computer running Rhombus that is always on and always connected to the internet. A Raspberry Pi 3 or comparable device (DSD) makes a perfect staking node as it consumes very little energy, is compact and easy to tailor for dedicated tasks.</description>

Requirements Before starting the setup process, make sure you have:
 Cold staking public key – you can get it by either:  self-hosting a cold staking node (on Raspberri Pi/Rock64 etc.) or by joining one of the available staking pools   A Ledger hardware wallet with Rhombus installed on it Ledger Live app ready to use Rhombus Core wallet installed and fully synced  Staking setup Get your staking public key Staking Pool  Via staking pool Choose one of the available staking pools and note somewhere its staking public key (they are usually right there on the top of the page).</description>

Decentralized moderation Since it is fully anonymous, it is not unlikely that undesirable items and services would be listed for sale. This is why there has to be a way to moderate the marketplace. This ensures the marketplace preserves its legitimacy and that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t become an enabler of immoral businesses and activities.</description>

      <description>About checksums While compiling from source is the recommended and most secure way to build the Rhombus platform, the team realizes this is an advanced technique that a large number of users aren&amp;rsquo;t comfortable with. For most users, each release is distributed with source code and pre-compiled distributions for Windows, Mac &amp;amp; Linux.
To ensure the highest level of security, the Rhombus Project team provides sha256sums for all of these releases.</description>

      <description>Contrary to on-chain storage, storing data on DSN allows the platform to scale well regardless of the amount of data it uses. This form of storage works without relying on servers and without centralizing powers into masternodes.
About DSN DSN is a generic term that describes a specific set of software with the purpose of storing and retrieving data on the internet. The usage of the term DSN is simply a layer of abstraction.</description>

      <description>About SMSG SMSG is a decentralized P2P message mixnet where all nodes store a copy of everyone&amp;rsquo;s end-to-end encrypted messages and data for a duration of 48 hours (which can be increased for a fee).
 It is the default and most private DSN available for use on the platform.
 The reference implementation is developed in C++ and incorporated into the Rhombus daemon. It operates parallel to Rhombus&amp;rsquo;s network and is hosted on the same nodes running the blockchain.</description>
