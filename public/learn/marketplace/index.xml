      <description>About MAD Escrow Game Theory How does it work? Private by design Scalability     About MAD Escrow Marketplaces usually have mechanisms in place to resolve disputes between buyers and vendors. This is a vital part of e-commerce because trusting strangers, especially when money is involved, has never proven to be reliable. As buyers and vendors do not know and trust each other, there has to be protection against one of the party never honoring their end of the trade.</description>

      <description>Traditional marketplaces usually have pretty complicated or extensive fee schedules. Depending on various variables such as what kind of products you sell, the number of transactions you do, your membership subscription plan, your feedback, and similar sets of data, fees can vary greatly.
The total cost associated with selling online usually includes a listing fee, a final value fee (sales fee taken on the value of the item), a subscription fee, a payment processing fee, escrow fee, and more.</description>

      <description>It is instead governed by its community of holders rather than a team of staff or a third-parties.
Decentralized moderation Since it is fully anonymous, it is not unlikely that undesirable items and services would be listed for sale. This is why there has to be a way to moderate the marketplace. This ensures the marketplace preserves its legitimacy and that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t become an enabler of immoral businesses and activities.</description>

      <description>They are not accessible from the public interface of the Open Marketplace. The only way to access them is by entering their unique Market ID in the Rhombus Desktop client.
The Market ID is only known to the person that initially generated the private market and to the people he shared it with. While private markets aren&amp;rsquo;t part of the first mainnet version of the Open Marketplace, they will be implemented during the Beta phase of development.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s currency agnosticism? Atomic Swaps Third-Party Integrations     What&amp;rsquo;s currency agnosticism? That means buyers aren&amp;rsquo;t limited to using the RHOM coin as a form of payment. They are able to use many currencies, including Bitcoin, among others. This provides a use-case for many different coins and gives them a fee-less and untraceable way to spend their cryptocurrencies without having to either go through a third-party or sell their coins for fiat on exchanges.</description>

      <title>Data Storage Network (DSN)</title>
      <link>https://rhombus.io/wiki/learn/marketplace/data-storage-network/</link>

      <guid>https://rhombus.io/wiki/learn/marketplace/data-storage-network/</guid>
      <description>Contrary to on-chain storage, storing data on DSN allows the platform to scale well regardless of the amount of data it uses. This form of storage works without relying on servers and without centralizing powers into masternodes.
About DSN DSN is a generic term that describes a specific set of software with the purpose of storing and retrieving data on the internet. The usage of the term DSN is simply a layer of abstraction.</description>

      <description>About SMSG SMSG is a decentralized P2P message mixnet where all nodes store a copy of everyone&amp;rsquo;s end-to-end encrypted messages and data for a duration of 48 hours (which can be increased for a fee).
 It is the default and most private DSN available for use on the platform.
 The reference implementation is developed in C++ and incorporated into the Rhombus daemon. It operates parallel to Rhombus&amp;rsquo;s network and is hosted on the same nodes running the blockchain.</description>
